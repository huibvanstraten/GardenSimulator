# GardenSimulator
Type in how many days you want to simulate. And watch your garden blossom!Or wither..
----------------------------

A selfmade assignment

Through inheretance, encapsulation and polymorphism, I made an intertwined network of classes who react different depending on random conditions. 

In short: 
- you can instantiate different plants and give them their own parameters
- Those plants are linked with the ground and take water from them
- If they get enough water for an amount of days, they bare fruit
- If the ground is dry or soaked, the plants die. So.. no more fruit
- The water comes from rain. The weather is randomized
- The water is held in the ground, and in a waterbarrel
- There is a gardener. He comes every couple of days. If the weather is bad, he skips a day. 
- When he is there, he gives water to the plants. If the ground is soaked, he doesn't. The amount he gives is dependend on the amount in the barrel
- You can choose how many days you want the simulator to run. In the end you get a summary of how much you harvested
